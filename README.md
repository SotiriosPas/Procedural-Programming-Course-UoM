The exercise files are all named in this manner: a(exercise number)f(exercise sheet number). Regrettably not every exercise sheet was preserved.
The i.dat files are necessary for some c exercises since they read directly from them. Files with different names are projects outside the aforementioned exercise sheets but still part of the course.
The course is finished.
